November 24th, 2019:
    Things we did:
        - Understood basics of project
        - Set up git up for project
        - Created docker-compose.yml so that we have a redis conatiner in communication with our server
        - Server is able to connect to redis now because of it (we use docker stack deply to deploy our application)
