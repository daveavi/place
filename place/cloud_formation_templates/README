#TODO:
- edit cluster, to set loadbalancer's stickiness to 7 days
- edit elasticache cluster and service to attach together automatically
	- elasticache needs to allow access to fargate services on default port
		- how this works now is I manually add incomming rule to elasticache security group to add load balancers security group
	- app needs to know, elasticache's endpoint before it starts up
